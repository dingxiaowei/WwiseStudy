								<td><font size="-1"> Cube is a tiny game engine hosting a singleplayer/multiplayer fps 
										game (see features below). You will want to read (roughly this order):
										<ul>
											<li>
												<a href="docs/config.html">config</a>: on running the game, the 
											FAQ,&nbsp;and configuring it for your machine
											<li>
												<a href="docs/game.html">game</a>: information on gameplay
											<li>
												<a href="docs/editing.html">editing</a>: map making tutorial
											<li>
												<a href="docs/editref.html">reference</a>: map making reference
											<li>
												<a href="docs/history.html">history</a>: for seeing latest changes</li>
										</ul>
										note well: the engine is VERY different from any engine you have seen before. 
										Failure to read the documentation in its entirety may cause you to:
										<ul>
											<li>
											miss out on the cool features.
											<li>
											run it in an unoptimal way for your system.
											<li>
												conclude it "sucks" prematurely.</li>
										</ul>
										thanks :)
