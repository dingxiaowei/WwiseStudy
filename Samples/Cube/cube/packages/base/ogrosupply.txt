Ogro's Army Supply Base

v1.1

by David "Drakker" Pelletier
January 2004 (originaly started in 2002)


Changes in v1.1:

-Blown a hole in the big garage like door with a teleport that leads to the blue room.
-Added a teleport to the small corridors with the windows that leads to the outside section.
-Changed a lot of powerups and ammoes, balance should be better now.
-Lowered crates piles so you can pick up powerups from everyside without having to jump 18 times.
-Made fog a bit thicker so the sand looks red from the inside and the inside looks creepier from the outside.

Original version didn't have a version number
